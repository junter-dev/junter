# FILING ISSUES

### Purpose:
Issues are an essential aspect of the development process. They help us track tasks,
enhancements, bugs, and more. When filing an issue, please follow the guidelines
below to ensure clarity and efficiency.

1. Check for Existing Issues:
   Before you file a new issue, please search the existing issues to avoid duplicates.
   Duplicate issues can divide the conversation and waste the time of developers and
   users.

2. Be Clear and Specific:
   Use a descriptive title for your issue. Instead of "bug in the code,
   " prefer "Error
   404 when accessing the 'settings' page.
   "

3. Provide Detailed Information:
   The more information you provide, the easier for us to understand and resolve the
   issue. Include:
   ● Environment: Specify your operating system, browser version, and other
   relevant environment details.
   ● Steps to Reproduce: Outline the exact steps to reproduce the issue.
   ● Expected Behavior: Describe what you expected to happen.
   ● Actual Behavior: Explain what happened.
   ● Screenshots: If applicable, add screenshots to help demonstrate the problem.

4. Use Labels (If Available):
   If our system supports labels, please use them. Labels like `bug`,
   `enhancement`, `question`, and `documentation` can help categorize and prioritize the issue.

5. Respect Others:
   Engage in constructive dialogue when discussing issues. Remember that behind
   every issue is a human being.

6. Stay Engaged:
   Please stay engaged with your issue after filing. You might be asked for further
   details or clarifications as others look into it.

7. Closing Issues:
   Issues will be closed once they've been resolved or if they become stale due to
   inactivity. If you believe an issue was closed prematurely, provide a comment
   explaining why and we'll consider reopening it.
